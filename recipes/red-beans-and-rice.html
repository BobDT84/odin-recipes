    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        Use the knife and cutting board to dice your bell pepper, onion, and celery.
        If you want to reduce the water in the crockpot, then use a pan on the stove at medium heat 
        to sweat the vegetables before pouring them into the crock pot.  Drain the liquid from the 
        cans of kidney beans and pour them into the crockpot.  Stir the beans and the vegetables 
        until evenly distributed, and turn the crockpot on high.  Slice your smoked sausage into 
        round disks before adding them to the crockpot.  Pour in 1 or 2 half cap full of the liquid 
        shrimp & crab boil.  Finally, add the 3 bay leaves, if you have them, and lock the lid on the 
        crockpot and let the ingredients cook for 4 hours on high.  Give a stir after 2 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        With 1 hour remaining of the previous ingredients cooking in the crockpot, use 
        <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> to search for instructions on how to cook rice.  Cooking 
        rice has been, and continues to be one of my weaknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the rice and beans are cooked, open the lid of the crockpot and enjoy the wonderful smells and steam 
        bath that will instantly fog your glasses.  If you can easily find the bay leaves, then go ahead and remove 
        them now.  I prefer to add rice to a bowl, and stir in just the liquids from the crockpot before adding the 
        beans, vegetables, and sausage.  I aim for a ratio of 2/3 rice to 1/3 other.  But the great thing about red 
        beans and rice is that it is affordable, and you can experiment with multiple styles of plating.
